#Material Design

####This is a small tutorial for how to use web components in HTML documents and will gradually become the web page for a new material linux redesign.

I'll write this later though.

##How to install



##SUPER IMPORTANT NOTE


Web components do NOT run locally. They can only run when deployed to localhost or on some server somewhere. 

I have no idea why. You're best bet is to simply navigate to the projects directory and run 
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
This command sets up the index.html (or presumably whatever you tell bower) on [http://localhost:8000/index.html](http://localhost:8000/index.html). 


If you go there you'll see custom web components! exciting!
